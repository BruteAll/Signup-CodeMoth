1. Generate SSL key and cert files for encryption: client-key.pem and client-cert.pem.
2. If using an existing database, get its encryption key file, "encryption_key.conf", and put it in the same folder as index.js.
3. Create a file called "adminpwd.conf" and write the admin password in it. This is the password to access the list of signups.
3. If in production, set the "PRODUCTION" constant in index.js to true.
4. Run "node index.js"
